# YOLOV3
This is a pytorch and python based yolov3 project. You can also access darknet version in github. Corresponding paper is in

[DOI]: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf	"yolov3. "

Software required:

- [x] pytorch >=1.4
- [x] numpy
- [x] opencv
- [x] matplotlib
- [x] tqdm
- [x] torchvision
- [x] tensorboard
- [x] onnx
- [x] onnxruntime
- [x] openvino

Use the following command to train your neural network:

```bash
python train.py --cfg yours.cfg --weights yours.weights --batch-size 8 --epoch 50 --devices 0,1
```

And test your trained model as following:

```bash
 python detect.py --cfg yours.cfg --weights yours.weights --source img_path
```

If openvino is used in your project, there  are also containing convert code.

In order to get openvino model, you should convert pytorch model to onnx  by command like following:

```bash
python tools/pytorch2onnx.py
```

after installing  openvino sdk, using following command:

```bash
python mo_onnx.py --input_model model/yolov3.onnx --output_dir model
```

then,  yolov3.xml and yolov3.bin can be written to model path.

#### Python based openvino test demo „ÄÅknowledge distillation and quantization code will be shown soon.
